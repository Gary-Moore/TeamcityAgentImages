# TeamCity Custom Docker Build Agents

This repository contains custom TeamCity build agent images for Windows and Linux, along with supporting scripts for building and publishing these images to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). These images are designed to be used as TeamCity agents in our CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ ACR Task Workflow (Current)

Agent images are now built and published via ACR Tasks, which run multi-step build pipelines directly inside Azure. This avoids the need for local Docker builds inside TeamCity and ensures reproducibility.

### Provisioning ACR Tasks

An ACR Task must exist in your registry before you can trigger builds. This is handled idempotently by the script:
```bash
./scripts/provision-acr-task-linux.sh
```

This script will create or update the registered ACR Task (tc-agent-linux) that builds the Linux TeamCity agent. It validates all required environment variables before running.

#### Example usage
```bash
# Azure SP credentials
export AZ_TENANT_ID="xxxx-xxxx"
export AZ_CLIENT_ID="xxxx-xxxx"
export AZ_CLIENT_SECRET="super-secret"
export AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="xxxx-xxxx"
export AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-container-reg"

# ACR config
export ACR_NAME="gammawebdevops"
export ACR_TASK_NAME="tc-agent-linux"
export TASK_FILE="acr/teamcity-agent.linux.yaml"
export GIT_CONTEXT="https://github.com/Gary-Moore/TeamcityAgentImages.git#main"

# GitHub access token (read-only scope for private repo)
export GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Run provisioning
./scripts/provision-acr-task-linux.sh
```

On success:

- Task is created or updated in ACR.
- JSON definition is written to acr-task.json (publishable as a TeamCity artifact).
- A summary table is printed.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Provisioning is a one-off or occasional operation (e.g. when YAML moves/changes). TeamCity build jobs should not re-run provisioning; they should only trigger the registered task.

## Running ACR Tasks in TeamCity

To build and publish images, TeamCity calls:
```bash
az acr task run \
  -r acrname \
  -n tc-agent-linux \
  --set image_tag=2025.08-linux-sudo-dotnet8-node20 \
  --set dotnet_sdk_version=8.0 \
  --set node_major=20 \
  --set base_image=jetbrains/teamcity-agent:2025.07-linux-sudo \
  --set-secret entrust_sha256=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --set entrust_url=https://crt.sectigo.com/EntrustOVTLSIssuingRSACA2.crt
```

This triggers the registered task, which:
1. Builds the image with the correct .NET + Node versions.
2. Runs the smoke test (test-image.sh).
3. Pushes the image into ACR only if tests succeed.
4. Writes runtime metadata (/opt/pds-runtime.json) which is extracted into a manifest.json artifact.

## üêã Legacy Build and Publish Workflow

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated: The scripts below (build-image.sh, publish-image.sh) are retained in /legacy for reference but should no longer be used. All new images must be built via ACR Tasks as described above.

Each agent has its own build process. The build scripts will:

1. **Authenticate with Azure Container Registry (ACR)** using your ACR credentials.
2. Build the **TeamCity agent** Docker image.
3. Tag the image according to the **OS, .NET SDK version, and Node.js version**.
4. Push the image to **ACR**.

### Authenticating to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Before building or pushing any images, ensure you are authenticated to Azure Container Registry.

#### Local Development

For interactive local use, run:

```bash
az acr login --name myacr
```

Replace `myacr` with your Azure Container Registry name.

#### CI/CD (TeamCity)

In CI pipelines (e.g., TeamCity), authentication is performed using a **service principal**. Set the following TeamCity environment variables (marked as hidden/secure):

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

Then use the following login command in a build step before pushing to ACR:

```bash
az login --service-principal \
  --username "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID" \
  --password "$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --tenant "$AZURE_TENANT_ID"

az acr login --name myacr
```

These credentials should be stored securely as TeamCity environment variables:

* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`

* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`


The build process requires a version number to tag the image. This version is automatically generated from your Git tags and stored in the `VERSION.txt` file.

### To generate the `VERSION.txt` file:

```bash
./scripts/generate-version.sh
```

The build script will fail if `VERSION.txt` is missing.

### TeamCity Tip

In TeamCity, run `generate-version.sh` as a build step before `build-image.sh`. As a fallback, you may use `%build.vcs.number%` or date-based tags.

## Image Testing

Use the provided script to validate that your built image contains the correct tools.

### Default Check (e.g., .NET and Node.js):

```bash
./test-image.sh -n teamcity-agent-dotnet8-node20 -t latest
```

### Custom Check (e.g., Terraform agent):

```bash
./test-image.sh -n teamcity-terraform-agent -t latest -c "terraform version"
```

üêã Agent Image Publishing Strategy

### Overview
All TeamCity custom agent images are tagged using the following standard scheme:

| Tag                  | Purpose                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `YYYY-MM-DD` or VCS number | Every build gets a unique tag based on the date or VCS commit ID for auditability. |
| `latest`             | Automatically assigned to the most recent image built (weekly or on commit). |
| `standard`           | Manually promoted tag representing a stable, recommended image version. |
| `dotnet-8.0-node-20` | A specific version of the image built with .NET 8.0 and Node.js 20. Useful for backwards compatibility in certain pipelines. |
| `dotnet-10.0-node-20` | A specific version built with .NET 10.0 and Node.js 20. For projects migrating to the latest version. |

### Publishing Process

| Step                | Description                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `build-image.sh`     | Builds the agent image locally.                                 |
| `test-image.sh`      | Runs basic validation tests on the image.                       |
| `publish-image.sh`   | Pushes the image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and applies optional tags. |

## TeamCity Build Parameters

| Parameter           | Example                             | Notes                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `env.IMAGE_NAME`    | `myacr.azurecr.io/teamcity-agent-dockercli` | Full image name                     |
| `env.IMAGE_TAG`     | `2025-03-25` or `%build.vcs.number%` | Image version, e.g., date or VCS ID |
| `env.TAG_LATEST`    | `true`                              | Pushes `:latest` tag if set         |
| `env.TAG_STANDARD`  | `true`                              | Pushes `:standard` tag if set       |

## Example Publishing Command
```bash
./scripts/publish-image.sh -n %env.IMAGE_NAME% -t %env.IMAGE_TAG% --tag-latest --verbose

# Set --tag-standard only when promoting a known-good image.
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on the build machine or agent.
- Azure CLI must be installed (`az`) for authentication.
- A valid Azure login or service principal must be configured.
- `VERSION.txt` must be generated before running `build-image.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

### ACR Login Fails with `az login` Required

Ensure you're authenticated with Azure:

- Use `az login` locally
- Use `az login --service-principal` in CI

### "Docker: Cannot connect to the daemon"

Ensure:
- Docker is running on the agent host
- The `buildagent` user is in the `docker` group
- The agent has access to `/var/run/docker.sock`
